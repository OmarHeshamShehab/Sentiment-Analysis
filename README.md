## Project Overview

The **Sentiment-Analysis** web application allows users to enter a block of text (such as social media posts or reviews) and receive an analysis of its sentiment. The sentiment is classified as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. The machine learning model behind this app has been trained on a dataset of reviews to identify sentiment based on the text.

## File and Folder Description

### app.py
   - **Description**: This is the main Python script that runs the Flask web application. It loads the trained sentiment analysis model, handles input from the user via the web interface, and returns the sentiment prediction to the user.

### model
   - **Description**: This folder contains the pre-trained sentiment analysis model that is loaded by `app.py` to make predictions on user input.

### reviews.csv
   - **Description**: This file contains the dataset used for training the sentiment analysis model. It includes user reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels.

### train_model.ipynb
   - **Description**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code used to train the sentiment analysis model. It processes the `reviews.csv` dataset, builds the model, and saves it for use in the web application.

### static and templates folders
   - **Description**: These folders contain the static files (like CSS, JavaScript, images) and HTML templates for the web application's frontend. The `templates` folder contains HTML files rendered by Flask, and `static` holds the styling and other frontend assets.
